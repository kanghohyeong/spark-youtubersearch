I audioswapped the background noise, as it contained secrets! They graze and produce wool!
The grazing animation is slightly stiff, but I think it works. Their damage has been turned way down here so I can survive. Testing ridable mine carts. The physics change when you're riding them (more inertia, less friction). You can pick them up now, too! It might be hard to tell, but there's about 10 different biomes in this video. The most obvious ones are the arctic ones (with and without trees) and the desert ones. I will spend time on giving the other ones unique looking features like new trees and so.
Grass, leaf and sky color varies depending on the temperature and humidity in the area you are.
The music is by C418. Left mouse button to attack, right mouse button to interact (ie place blocks). Monsters can be hurt, but there's no death animation yet. Wow, this has got to be some kind of milestone. For the first time ever, there's both mining and crafting in the game! You can try this already in the indev version. I finally managed to implement the dynamic light engine I had in mind for Minecraft. It adds no performance penalty per frame, and a small one every time a tile changes (especially if it changes brightness).
I think this is pretty much the perfect mix between speediness, dynamicness and prettiness.

You will be able to turn this off for old hardware This is a very early test of an Infiniminer clone I'm working on. It will have more resource management and materials, if I ever get around to finishing it.

It currently runs at about 700 fps for a 256x256x64 tile map.

You can follow development on my blog: http://notch.tumblr.com/ This is a five minute cycle just to show it off. It will probably be about 20 minutes in the game.
Monsters far away from the player vanish very fast in daylight, and they only spawn at the surface during night.
Plants and farms should survive the night, even if they've got glass ceilings. And here's the effect in action.
I'm not so sure about this.. Testing what kind of terrain the level generator actually produces. This is a straight line fly-over of normal randomly generated terrain in Minecraft Alpha.

In the distant future, there will be more variation such as different terrain types (desert! swamp! snow!) and settlements (goblin village! abandoned stone tower! dragon lair!)

You will be able to turn this off for old hardware The map is 512x512x64 These models won't be in the final game. This is just a test of the md3 rendering, and it's working pretty well except for some broken animations. There are mobs and the terrain is interactive now! Grass turns into dirt if it doesn't get sun, and grass spreads to nearby dirt tiles.
Sorry about the low quality.. I blame CamStudio, or possibly the codec. Showing off the new mob code, visible armor pieces, new mining system (with a new animation when picking up resources), and a total lack of the annoying white glow on hovered tiles. Just a tiny video to show the creeper smoldering effect This is a timelapse of me creating my entry for the 21'st Ludum Dare competition.

The music is by C418. Playing around with the recently implemented finite water in Minecraft. Me playing around with farming (coming to indev today) in Minecraft. Testing the new tool (hoe), and waiting for crops to grow. Fun stuff. A similar effect can be used for snow and hail. Obviously slow will need to land on the ground as well. New tile type?

The song is called Battery, and was made by me some nine years ago.

The game was all made within 48 hours (from scratch). If you liked this video, there's a whole bunch more timelapse videos from people participating in the same competition here: http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=E8DC350F18C043D5&sort_field=original&page=1 Playing around with the new level generation options.
If you've purchased the game, you can try the latest development version of the game here: http://www.minecraft.net/indev/ This is a test of the fire system in Minecraft, on an extra dark Hell level, with the rate of fire spread turned way up. Later on, fire won't consume the entire world, to prevent too easy griefing.

The fire texture is animated, glows, and spreads. This game was made over 48 hours, for the 16th Ludum Dare competition.
I broadcasted the whole thing live to Livestream, and took a screenshot of my main monitor once every ten seconds. I combined those screenshots into a 55 fps movie, combined with a song I wrote a few years ago, called Norepinephrine.

There are some graphical bugs, and the water doesn't really update as smoothly as I'd like, but here's a first test of the water in Minecraft.

The fire texture is animated, glows, and spreads. I FINALLY got stair physics to work well and solidly. If the physics ever hit a wall, it tries moving up half a tile and sees if it gets further by doing that. If it does, it starts a small animation and won't take another step like that until the animation finishes.
There are a few bugs and issues still (as can be seen in the video), but it's looking good. A similar effect can be used for snow and hail. Obviously slow will need to land on the ground as well.
